Belling the Cat
===============
Making CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) data available as Linked Open Data (LOD): A practical hands-on workshop of a complete solution using freeware
---------------

*The mice meet in council to debate the problem of the new cat in the district. One suggests that a bell should be attached to the cat to give a warning. This is greeted with universal approval until someone asks "How?"*

Abstract
--------
Cultural Heritage Informatics specialists are often heard to say “just publish your CRM data as linked open data so that others can use it”, but how do we actually do that? This workshop aims to lead attendees through the process of taking an export of delimited text (ie. comma separated values) from their database, converting it to CRM compatible RDF/XML and then making them available via a triple store for consumption by humans or machines as LOD.

The course will provide an introduction to LOD and then will lead users through a cookbook of simple to follow techniques for creating and publishing it. All software used in the workshop will be freeware and runs on the free and open source operating system Linux. The software and operating system are uniquely capable of running on underpowered hardware, making deploying it simple even with limited support from an IT department or support services. The full set of software and guidelines will be available to attendees (if you bring a USB stick)

Details
-------
This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a server, setting up a triple store, populating that triple store with your data, and publishing your data as LOD. This process will use a Raspberry Pi (RPi) as the server hardware, a Linux based operating system, and free and open source software for the triple store and application server. The tutorial assumes that you are using a RPi, but if the attendee does not have a physical RPi available to them, a VirtualBox virtual machine with a similar OS (Ubuntu) and similar specs can be used. The RPi is only used for the novelty of building a full LOD Server on a device like that. These instructions could be followed to build the same solution stack on different hardware as long as a Debian-based (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint) Linux OS is used.
