Now you have a partially set up LOD Server running on either a RPi or an underpowered Linux server. The running of a LOD Server in a production environment will no doubt be different, but that will dependent on your own environment and domain. The initial steps of this tutorial should prepare you to create and host your own Linked Open Data, but the final *publication* of that data should be guided by your own network adminstrators.

The original ADS LOD set up used a combination of AllegroGraph and Pubby. This kind of configuration can be investigated as well for people interested in a similar solution.
